        <h1>This is a main page</h1>
        <p>This week we learnt about HTML tags, elements and attributes</p>

        <h3>Tags in HTML</h3>
        <p>I would like to show some different tags that can be used in html.<br>
        some of the tags we learnt this week include:
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Strong</strong> tag</li>
            <li>The <i>Italics</i> tag</li>
            <li>The <em>Emphasis</em> tag</li>
            <li>The <a href="?">Link tag </a>that has an attribute and a target attribute<br> 
                that tells if the page should be open in a new page<em> href</em></li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>We also learnt about the iframe, video and audio tags that make it easier to put</p>

        <h2>Conventional structure HTML file</h2>
        <p>I would also like to show the different structure layout of the html file.<br>
        This structure was created to make HTML layout easier to divide.</p>

        <header>
            <h1>This is the header section where the Logo and name of company usually reside</h1>
        </header>
        <nav>
            <h3>This is the navigation bar where different links to other pages are set</h3>
            <a href="?">Home</a>
            <a href="?">About Us</a>
            <a href="?">Contact Us</a>
        </nav>

        <section>
            <h3>This is a section. Main contents of the HTML file mostly resides in the section.<br>
            We can have multiple sections in a single HTML file</h3>
        </section>

        <aside>
            <h3>This is an aside container. It is just like the section container.<br>
            The difference between the aside and section container is:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The Section container mostly holds the main contents of the webpage.</li>
                <li>The aside container mostly contains less important informations.</li>
                <li>The aside container can be also use to show messages on the different sections of the page if that makes any sense</li>
            </ol>
        </aside>

        <h3>Tables</h3>
